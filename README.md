# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys
In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. 

In this project, we will play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

1) Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigining due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
2) Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

The project demonstrates data analysis techniques such as:
  - Exploring data and preparing it for analysis
  - Correction of missing values
  - Discarding of unwanted data
  - Renaming of columns
  - Verification of the quality of data
  - Applying vectorized string methods and functions
  - Combining two datasets
  - Aggregating data
